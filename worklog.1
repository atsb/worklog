.SH NAME
worklog \-  a program for keeping track of time spent on different projects
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B worklog
[<project config file> [<log file>]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  worklog
is a program that helps you keep track of your time.
.I  worklog
is a simple ncurses based based program that runs a clock and logs
time to a logfile.  When
.I worklog
is invoked, it reads the project configuration file, and periodically
appends to the log file throughout the extent of its run.
Individual logfiles are also kept on a per\-project basis.
The key of each project is used to construct a separate log file
made unique by appending .X to the name of the main log file
where X is the key character.  Press Control-L to redraw the
screen (sometimes useful when resizing the window).


.SH THE PROJECT CONFIGURATION FILE
The
.I project configuration file
is a text file containing a project and its associated key-character
on seperate lines.  The format of a project line is :

.B <key>:<name>

Comments may be preceded by the # character

.SH EXAMPLE PROJECT CONFIGURATION FILE
.br
.nf
# Worklog project file
# note that projects appear in Worklog in REVERSE order
